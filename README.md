Welcome to my CS 577 final project! I analyzed data from a dataset given here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/janus137/mlb-postseason-2024-pitch-by-pitch-data?resource=download and used a grading algorithm after some data analysis to try and find the best pitch type a pitcher can throw during a game for the best results. Enjoy!
